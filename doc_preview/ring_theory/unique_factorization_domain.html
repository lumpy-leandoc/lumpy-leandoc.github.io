<p>In a unique factorization domain each element (except zero) is uniquely
represented as a multiset of irreducible factors.
Uniqueness is only up to associated elements.</p>
<p>This is equivalent to defining a unique factorization domain as a domain in
which each element (except zero) is non-uniquely represented as a multiset
of prime factors. This definition is used.</p>
<p>To define a UFD using the traditional definition in terms of multisets
of irreducible factors, use the definition <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">of_unique_irreducible_factorization</span></p>

<p><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">multiset α</span> produced by <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">factors</span> are only unique up to associated elements, while the multisets in
<span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">factor_set α</span> are unqiue by equality and restricted to irreducible elements. This gives us a
representation of each element as a unique multisets (or the added ⊤ for 0), which has a complete
lattice struture. Infimum is the greatest common divisor and supremum is the least common multiple.</p>
