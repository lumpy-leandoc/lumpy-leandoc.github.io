<p>This file defines the minimal polynomial of an element x of an A-algebra B,
under the assumption that x is integral over A.</p>
<p>After stating the defining property we specialize to the setting of field extensions
and derive some well-known properties, amongst which the fact that minimal polynomials
are irreducible, and uniquely determined by their defining property.</p>
