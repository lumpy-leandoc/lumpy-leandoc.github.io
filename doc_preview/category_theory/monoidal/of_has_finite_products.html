<p>A category with a monoidal structure provided in this way is sometimes called a (co)cartesian category,
although this is also sometimes used to mean a finitely complete category.
(See https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cartesian+category.)</p>
<p>As this works with either products or coproducts, we don't set up either construct as an instance.</p>
