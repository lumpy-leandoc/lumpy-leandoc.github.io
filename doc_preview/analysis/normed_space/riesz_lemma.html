<p>Riesz's lemma, stated for a normed space over a normed field: for any
closed proper subspace F of E, there is a nonzero x such that ∥x - F∥
is at least r * ∥x∥ for any r &lt; 1.</p>
<hr/><div class="decl"><h4>riesz_lemma</h4><div class="decl_par"><p>Riesz's lemma, which usually states that it is possible to find a
vector with norm 1 whose distance to a closed proper subspace is
arbitrarily close to 1. The statement here is in terms of multiples of
norms, since in general the existence of an element of norm exactly 1
is not guaranteed.</p>
