<p>This file defines measurable spaces and the functions and isomorphisms
between them.</p>
<p>A measurable space is a set equipped with a σ-algebra, a collection of
subsets closed under complementation and countable union. A function
between measurable spaces is measurable if the preimage of each
measurable subset is measurable.</p>
<p>σ-algebras on a fixed set α form a complete lattice. Here we order
σ-algebras by writing m₁ ≤ m₂ if every set which is m₁-measurable is
also m₂-measurable (that is, m₁ is a subset of m₂). In particular, any
collection of subsets of α generates a smallest σ-algebra which
contains all of them. A function f : α → β induces a Galois connection
between the lattices of σ-algebras on α and β.</p>
<p>A measurable equivalence between measurable spaces is an equivalence
which respects the σ-algebras, that is, for which both directions of
the equivalence are measurable functions.</p>
<h2>Main statements</h2>
<p>The main theorem of this file is Dynkin's π-λ theorem, which appears
here as an induction principle <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">induction_on_inter</span>. Suppose s is a
collection of subsets of α such that the intersection of two members
of s belongs to s whenever it is nonempty. Let m be the σ-algebra
generated by s. In order to check that a predicate C holds on every
member of m, it suffices to check that C holds on the members of s and
that C is preserved by complementation and <em>disjoint</em> countable
unions.</p>
<h2>Implementation notes</h2>
<p>Measurability of a function f : α → β between measurable spaces is
defined in terms of the Galois connection induced by f.</p>
