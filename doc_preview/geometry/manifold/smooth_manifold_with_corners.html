<p>A smooth manifold is a manifold modelled on a normed vector space, or a subset like a
half-space (to get manifolds with boundaries) for which the change of coordinates are smooth maps.
We define a model with corners as a map I : H ‚Üí E embedding nicely the topological space H in the
vector space E (or more precisely as a structure containing all the relevant properties).
Given such a model with corners I on (E, H), we define the groupoid of local
homeomorphisms of H which are smooth when read in E (for any regularity n : with_top ‚Ñï).
With this groupoid at hand and the general machinery of manifolds, we thus get the notion of C^n
manifold with respect to any model with corners I on (E, H). We also introduce a specific type
class for C^‚àû manifolds as these are the most commonly used.</p>
<h2>Main definitions</h2>
<p><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">model_with_corners ùïú E H</span> :
a structure containing informations on the way a space H embeds in a
model vector space E over the field ùïú. This is all that is needed to
define a smooth manifold with model space H, and model vector space E.
<span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">model_with_corners_self ùïú E</span> :
trivial model with corners structure on the space E embedded in itself by the identity.
<span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">times_cont_diff_groupoid n I</span> :
when I is a model with corners on (ùïú, E, H), this is the groupoid of local homeos of H
which are of class C^n over the normed field ùïú, when read in E.
<span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">smooth_manifold_with_corners I M</span> :
a type class saying that the manifold M, modelled on the space H, has C^‚àû changes of
coordinates with respect to the model with corners I on (ùïú, E, H). This type class is just
a shortcut for <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">has_groupoid M (times_cont_diff_groupoid ‚ä§ I)</span></p>
<p>As specific examples of models with corners, we define (in the file <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">real_instances.lean</span>)</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">euclidean_space n</span> for a model vector space of dimension <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">n</span>.</li>
<li><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">model_with_corners ‚Ñù (euclidean_space n) (euclidean_half_space n)</span> for the model space used
to define <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">n</span>-dimensional real manifolds with boundary and</li>
<li><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">model_with_corners ‚Ñù (euclidean_space n) (euclidean_quadrant n)</span> for the model space used
to define <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">n</span>-dimensional real manifolds with corners</li>
</ul>
<p>With these definitions at hand, to invoke an <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">n</span>-dimensional real manifold without boundary,
one could use</p>
<p><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#859900;">variables</span><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;"> {n : ‚Ñï} {M : </span><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#268bd2;">Type</span><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#b58900;">*</span><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">} [topological_space M] [manifold (euclidean_space n)] [smooth_manifold_with_corners (model_with_corners_self ‚Ñù (euclidean_space n)) M]</span>.</p>
<p>However, this is not the recommended way: a theorem proved using this assumption would not apply
for instance to the tangent space of such a manifold, which is modelled on
<span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">(euclidean_space n) √ó (euclidean_space n)</span> and not on <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">euclidean_space (</span><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#6c71c4;">2 </span><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#b58900;">*</span><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;"> n)</span>! In the same way,
it would not apply to product manifolds, modelled on <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">(euclidean_space n) √ó (euclidean_space m)</span>.
The right invocation does not focus on one specific construction, but on all constructions sharing
the right properties, like</p>
<p><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#859900;">variables</span><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;"> {E : </span><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#268bd2;">Type</span><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#b58900;">*</span><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">} [normed_group E] [normed_space ‚Ñù E] [finite_dimensional ‚Ñù E] {I : model_with_corners ‚Ñù E E} [I.boundaryless] {M : </span><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#268bd2;">Type</span><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#b58900;">*</span><span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">} [topological_space M] [manifold E M] [smooth_manifold_with_corners I M]</span></p>
<p>Here, <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">I.boundaryless</span> is a typeclass property ensuring that there is no boundary (this is for
instance the case for model_with_corners_self, or products of these). Note that one could consider
as a natural assumption to only use the trivial model with corners <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">model_with_corners_self ‚Ñù E</span>,
but again in product manifolds the natural model with corners will not be this one but the product
one (and they are not defeq as (Œªp : E √ó F, (p.1, p.2)) is not defeq to the identity). So, it is
important to use the above incantation to maximize the applicability of theorems.</p>
<h2>Implementation notes</h2>
<p>We want to talk about manifolds modelled on a vector space, but also on manifolds with
boundary, modelled on a half space (or even manifolds with corners). For the latter examples,
we still want to define smooth functions, tangent bundles, and so on. As smooth functions are
well defined on vector spaces or subsets of these, one could take for model space a subtype of a
vector space. With the drawback that the whole vector space itself (which is the most basic
example) is not directly a subtype of itself: the inclusion of <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">univ : set E</span> in <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">set E</span> would
show up in the definition, instead of <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">id</span>.</p>
<p>A good abstraction covering both cases it to have a vector
space E (with basic example the Euclidean space), a model space H (with basic example the upper half
space), and an embedding of H into E (which can be the identity for H = E, or
subtype.val for manifolds with corners). We say that the pair (E, H) with their embedding is a model
with corners, and we encompass all the relevant properties (in particular the fact that the image of
H in E should have unique differentials) in the definition of <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">model_with_corners</span>.</p>
<p>We concentrate on C^‚àû manifolds: all the definitions work equally well for C^n manifolds, but later
on it is a pain to carry all over the smoothness parameter, especially when one wants to deal with
C^k functions as there would be additional conditions k ‚â§ n everywhere. Since one deals almost all
the time with C^‚àû (or analytic) manifolds, this seems to be a reasonable choice that one could
revisit later if needed. C^k manifolds are still available, but they should be called using
<span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">has_groupoid M (times_cont_diff_groupoid k I)</span> where <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">I</span> is the model with corners.</p>
<p>I have considered using the model with corners <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">I</span> as a typeclass argument, possibly out_param, to
get lighter notations later on, but it did not turn out right, as on <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">E √ó F</span> there are two natural
model with corners, the trivial (identity) one, and the product one, and they are not defeq and one
needs to indicate to Lean which one we want to use.
This means that when talking on objects on manifolds one will most often need to specify the model
with corners one is using. For instance, the tangent bundle will be <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">tangent_bundle I M</span> and the
derivative will be <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">mfderiv I I&#39; f</span>, instead of the more natural notations <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">tangent_bundle ùïú M</span> and
<span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">mfderiv ùïú f</span> (the field has to be explicit anyway, as some manifolds could be considered both as
real and complex manifolds).</p>
